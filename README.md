# django-mtrk

Django-based Movie Tracker (mtrk).  This was an early project I was using to learn DJango.  The idea was to ditch the plastic shells of all my DVDs and Bluray's, moving the discs into sleeves that take considerably less space.  I kept the "frontpage" and barcode from the movie packaging. 

I explored using a barcode scanner to enable querying the database, and populating the asset information using an API from Amazon.

## Status
